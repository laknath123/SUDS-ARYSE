We first read in the Pittsburgh Police Arrest Data and examine the dataset.
```{r}
df = read.csv("PGH Police Arrest Data.csv")
df = df[complete.cases(df),]
head(df)
```


```{r}
df %>%
  group_by(INCIDENTNEIGHBORHOOD) %>%
  count(INCIDENTNEIGHBORHOOD, sort = TRUE)
```


```{r}
barplot(sort(prop.table(table(df$INCIDENTNEIGHBORHOOD)), decreasing = TRUE),las=2,cex.names=0.5, horiz = FALSE)
```


```{r}

```
